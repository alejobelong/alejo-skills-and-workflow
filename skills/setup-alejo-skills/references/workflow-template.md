# WORKFLOW.md Template

Use this official Symphony shape for the repo-owned `WORKFLOW.md`. Replace placeholders before publishing or writing it.

`WORKFLOW.md` is Markdown with optional YAML front matter. Symphony parses the front matter as runtime config and renders the Markdown body as the per-issue prompt template.

# Alejo Symphony TDD Workflow

You are Codex running under Symphony for one Linear vertical-slice implementation issue. Symphony schedules the issue and provides the isolated workspace; this `WORKFLOW.md` body is the per-issue prompt. The Linear issue XML is the implementation contract.

## Issue

- Identifier: `{{ issue.identifier }}`
- Title: `{{ issue.title }}`
- State: `{{ issue.state }}`
- Labels: `{{ issue.labels }}`
- Priority: `{{ issue.priority }}`
- URL: `{{ issue.url }}`
- Attempt: `{{ attempt }}`
- Blockers: `{{ issue.blocked_by }}`
- Branch hint: `{{ issue.branch_name }}`

### Description

{{ issue.description }}

## Mission

Implement the selected issue with a compact RED-GREEN-REFACTOR loop, using real production paths and real tests. A successful Symphony run ends by moving the issue to `Ready for Human`. Do not move issues to `Done`; only a human does that after the Alejo Run v2 BDD and review gate.

## Contract

- Treat the Linear issue XML as the compact implementation contract.
- Use repo code, tests, configs, run commands, provider adapters, migrations, routes, jobs, CI, and logs as evidence.
- Use Linear Project Documents only when the issue explicitly points to them or the contract is missing a required context link.
- Do not use local Alejo planning mirrors as canonical sources.
- Do not create `plan.md` or other local planning artifacts.
- Do not broaden scope; if you discover valuable out-of-scope work, comment it as a follow-up suggestion only.

## Preflight

1. If the issue is still in `Night Shift Queued`, move it to `In Night Shift`.
2. Verify the XML contract defines behavior, acceptance criteria, surface, preconditions, dependencies, providers, Doppler secret names or `None`, quality attributes, production constraints, representative prompts/actions when relevant, latency/timeout expectations, provider evidence, and slice-owned code organization.
3. Confirm dependencies are done or included in this run. If not, move the issue to `Ready for Human` with the blocker.
4. Check Doppler with name-only commands. Never print, log, paste, write, or comment secret values.
5. If required unsafe or human-owned secrets are missing, move the issue to `Ready for Human` with the exact missing secret names and setup action.
6. Identify the repo-declared test commands for the selected `api`, `ui`, `cli`, or `mcp` surface. If the repo has a relevant baseline command, run it before edits.
7. If the relevant baseline is failing for unrelated reasons, stop and record the baseline blocker instead of building on a broken signal.

## TDD Loop

Repeat one acceptance criterion at a time:

1. RED: add the smallest failing test that proves a real missing externally observable behavior. The failure must not be a syntax error, bad setup, trivial config check, mocked response, canned sample, or test that only asserts implementation details.
2. GREEN: implement the smallest production change that makes the failing test pass through the real surface.
3. REFACTOR: clean only touched code after the focused test and relevant suite are green.
4. Record the criterion, RED command/output summary, GREEN command/output summary, files changed, and remaining risk in `tdd_handoff.md` or the documented artifact sink.
5. Continue until every acceptance criterion is covered or a true blocker appears.

## Verification

- Run the repo-declared relevant tests before handoff. Use `doppler run -- <command>` when secrets or environment-backed config are required.
- For UI or browser-reachable behavior, run Playwright against the real running app and perform the end-user workflow.
- For chat or managed-agent behavior, use representative prompts/actions that require the promised provider capability and prove the response is not canned, mocked, stubbed, or disconnected.
- For provider, job, queue, scheduler, CLI, API, or MCP behavior, capture runtime-backed evidence that the integration is real.
- Do not accept mocks, fake providers, stubbed SDK responses, placeholder code, skipped tests, disabled branches, `NotImplemented`, TODO-only paths, unwired UI, or half-working behavior.

## Handoff

When the issue is implemented and verified:

1. Write or update `tdd_handoff.md` or the documented artifact sink with tests run, evidence, files changed, provider/runtime proof, and residual risks.
2. Add or update a concise Linear handoff comment with the same evidence summary.
3. Move the issue to `Ready for Human`.

When blocked:

1. Stop rather than guessing, mocking, or weakening tests.
2. Comment the issue id, failed acceptance criterion, failed command or evidence check, attempted repairs, and next required action.
3. Move or leave the issue in `Ready for Human`.

## Rules

- Do not ask for approval, permission, confirmation, or clarifying questions.
- Do not choose non-Codex coding agents.
- Do not expose secret values in chat, files, commands, logs, Linear, summaries, or commits.
- Do not advance issues with missing unsafe secrets.
- Do not move issues to `Done`.
- Do not run `alejo-review`; Alejo Run v2 owns BDD and review after this Symphony handoff.
- Do not mark work ready because Symphony launched, code changed, tests passed in isolation, or an issue moved lanes.
